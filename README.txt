Easy Python based webscraping with built in statistics. Uses BeautifulSoup and currently supports 
listings on eBay only. Will output prices in a CSV file from eBay webpages(as many as you like however 
3 pages recommended to prevent captcha/anti-bot). 
Price filter is available for accuracy and data preprocessing is also present in the code. 

Do not change the code or syntax just change the arguments/filters etc.

Libraries to install: 
requests
BeautifulSoup
csv
pandas
